Cookiecutter template suggestion
==========================

### Overview

Accoring do recent studies 42% of development time is spent dealing with maintenance of "bad" and unstructured code.

### Solution

Standardization of a code base is not only a path to reduce loss of time and money, but also provide transparency to developers, engineers and stakeholders.

### Technologies

- Black
    - Black is a code formatter, perfect for a task involving code standardization
- Cookiecutter
    - Leveraging cookiecutter features adds to the standardization process
- Sphinx
    - Creating project pages that outlines code documentation, Sphinx brings the much needed transparency into the code review process.

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/jonathanoakica/cookietest.git

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```

├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make environemnt` or `make requirements`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── custom_libraries   <- Customized code and scripts
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
├── docs               <- A default Sphinx project; see sphinx-doc.org for details
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
│
├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
│   └── figures        <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── setup.py           <- makes project pip installable (pip install -e .) so src can be imported
├── src                <- Source code for use in this project.
│   ├── __init__.py    <- Makes src a Python module
│   │
│   ├── data           <- Scripts to download or generate data
│   │   └── make_dataset.py
│   │
│   ├── features       <- Scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling
│   │   └── build_features.py
│   │
│   ├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
│   │   │                 predictions
